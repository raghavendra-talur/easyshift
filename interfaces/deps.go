// Deps is the wiring DTO: a bag of every side-effect implementation. app
// (production) and tests (fakes) populate it, then app.buildStages maps each
// field into the constructor of the stage that needs it. Stages do NOT
// receive Deps — they get exactly the interfaces they depend on. This struct
// exists only so construction has one well-known shape.
